   ```

4. Run the app

- Using Expo Go App:

1. Download the Expo Go app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) on your mobile device.
2. Run command to generate QR Code: npx expo start --go
3. Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer Tools or in your terminal using the Expo Go app.

- Using Android Emulator/ iOS Simulator

1. Run command: npm run android OR npm run ios

## Architecture

app/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx # Entry point
android/
â”œâ”€â”€ ... # Android-specific code and configurations
ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ ... # iOS-specific code and configurations
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/ # Contains images, fonts, icons, and other static resources
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/ # Stores color schemes and other predefined values used throughout the app.
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/ # Application screens
â”œâ”€â”€ database/ # Manages local database interactions, including schemas, queries, and data access logic.
â”œâ”€â”€ mockData/ # Holds mock data used for development and testing purposes.

Key Design Patterns:

- Component-Based Architecture: This project using component-based structure, e.g.: "src/components/" for reusable UI components and "src/screens/" for application screens. This follows Reactâ€™s philosophy of breaking the UI into reusable, self-contained pieces.
- Separation of Concerns: UI-related code is isolated from business logic (e.g., database interactions in src/database/). Constants like predefined values are centralized in src/constants/ for consistency.
- Mocking: Use of src/mockData/ suggests a pattern for mocking data during development and testing. This can swapping real and mock data sources dynamically.

## Testing

Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library

```bash
 npm test
```
